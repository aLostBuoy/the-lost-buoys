    <p>Thank you for viewing my website. This is only a project for the <span style="color:green;">Zero t</span><span style="color:purple;"Zero>o Mastery</span> <a href ="https://zerotomastery.io/courses/coding-bootcamp/" target="_blank">HTML course</a> and by filling in your details, you are not really joining the Lost Buoys. However, if you are not already an ocean swimmer, I highly recommend giving it a try. I am 31 and I was very afraid of swimming while growing up. But 4 years ago, I put myself in the pool and Iâ€™ve gradually progressed to where I am today; swimming in the sea, in togs with the help and support of my fellow Lost Buoys. You can become an ocean swimmer too! <em><span style="color:blue;"> Just keep swimming</em></span></p>
